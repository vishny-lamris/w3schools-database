## Journal
### 30.10.2024
Setting up the project was initially challenging due to my limited experience with Linux and Docker. I faced several issues with the scripts not working and the project failing to start. After some trial and error and guidance from ChatGPT, I identified missing dependencies and applications, particularly around Docker and Node.js. Once I reinstalled Node.js and resolved these issues, the project setup ran smoothly and I was able to get everything working as expected.

After conducting research on routing, I implemented routing functionality to enhance navigation within the application. Below are the newly integrated features:

1. **Get and List All Entities**
     - **Customers**
     - **Categories**
     - **Employees**
   - Utilized GET methods to retrieve and display data in organized tables for each entity.

2. **Create (Add) New Entries**
   - Enabled creation of new entries for:
     - **Customers**
     - **Categories**
     - **Employees**
   - Implemented POST methods for adding new records directly from the application.

3. **Update (Edit) Existing Entries**
   - Implemented PATCH methods to allow in-place updates for individual records in:
     - **Customers**
     - **Categories**

4. **Delete Entries**
   - Set up DELETE methods to remove records for:
     - **Customers**
     - **Categories**

5. **Sorting Functionality**
   - Added sorting functionality to all tables. Clicking on table headers allows sorting columns alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A) for easy data organization.

6. **Pagination**
   - Implemented pagination to handle large datasets, with Previous and Next buttons for smooth navigation across pages.

7. **Refresh List**
   - Added a Refresh button to reload data, ensuring that the list reflects the latest updates instantly.

8. **Filtering**
   - Integrated a filtering feature to enable users to quickly search within each entityâ€™s list for specific entries.

## Documentation

- Wrote technical documentation detailing the API methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for managing Customers, Categories, and Employees.
- Documented all new features and updated the project journal.

These additions greatly enhance usability, providing a seamless experience for managing data across all entities.
